## Welcome to My Learning Journey! ðŸ‘‹

Hi, I'm **Mohammed Adil Siraju**, a passionate AI & ML Engineer with a B.E. in Artificial Intelligence & Machine Learning (First Class with Distinction). This blog serves as both my learning documentation and portfolio, where I share my journey through the fascinating world of data science, machine learning, and deep learning.

### ðŸŽ¯ What You'll Find Here

- **Learning Progress**: My journey through the FastAI course and other ML/DL learning adventures
- **Project Showcases**: From computer vision models to MLOps implementations
- **Technical Insights**: Deep dives into algorithms, model optimization, and deployment strategies
- **Real-world Applications**: How I apply theoretical knowledge to solve practical problems

### ðŸš€ Current Focus

Currently pursuing the **FastAI course** to deepen my understanding of practical deep learning approaches. I'm particularly interested in computer vision applications and model deployment pipelines.

### ðŸ“Š Recent Highlights

- Built an **Architectural Style Classifier** achieving 73% accuracy across 25 architectural styles
- Implemented **CI/CD workflows for ML models**, reducing deployment cycle times by 30%
- Developing expertise in **MLOps** with Docker, Kubernetes, and automated deployment pipelines
