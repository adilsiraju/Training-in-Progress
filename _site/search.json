Transfer Learning is Powerful\nStarting with pre-trained models like ResNet significantly reduces training time and improves accuracy, especially with limited data.\n\n\n2. Data Augmentation Matters\nSimple transformations can dramatically improve model generalization:\n# Example augmentations\naug_transforms(\n    mult=0.5,  # Probability multiplier\n    do_flip=True,  # Random horizontal flips\n    flip_vert=False,  # No vertical flips for natural images\n    max_rotate=10.0,  # Slight rotations\n    max_zoom=1.1,  # Minor zoom variations\n    max_lighting=0.2,  # Lighting changes\n    max_warp=0.2  # Perspective warping\n)\n\n\n3. Learning Rate is Critical\nFinding the optimal learning rate using FastAI‚Äôs learning rate finder has been a game-changer:\n# Find optimal learning rate\nlearn.lr_find()\n\n# Use the suggested learning rate\nlearn.fine_tune(4, lr=1e-3)"
