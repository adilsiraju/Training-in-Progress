Here‚Äôs a simple example of building an image classifier:\nfrom fastai.vision.all import *\n\n# Create a DataBlock for image classification\ndls = ImageDataLoaders.from_folder(\n    path='data/images', \n    train='train', \n    valid='valid',\n    item_tfms=Resize(224),\n    batch_tfms=aug_transforms()\n)\n\n# Create a learner with a pre-trained model\nlearn = vision_learner(dls, resnet34, metrics=accuracy)\n\n# Fine-tune the model\nlearn.fine_tune(4)"

    "text": "Key Learnings So Far\n\n1. Transfer Learning is Powerful\nStarting with pre-trained models like ResNet significantly reduces training time and improves accuracy, especially with limited data.\n\n\n2. Data Augmentation Matters\nSimple transformations can dramatically improve model generalization:\n# Example augmentations\naug_transforms(\n    mult=0.5,  # Probability multiplier\n    do_flip=True,  # Random horizontal flips\n    flip_vert=False,  # No vertical flips for natural images\n    max_rotate=10.0,  # Slight rotations\n    max_zoom=1.1,  # Minor zoom variations\n    max_lighting=0.2,  # Lighting changes\n    max_warp=0.2  # Perspective warping\n)\n\n\n3. Learning Rate is Critical\nFinding the optimal learning rate using FastAI‚Äôs learning rate finder has been a game-changer:\n# Find optimal learning rate\nlearn.lr_find()\n\n# Use the suggested learning rate\nlearn.fine_tune(4, lr=1e-3)"
