## Building My First Image Classifier

Diving into computer vision with FastAI has been an incredible learning experience. Here's what I've discovered while building my first image classifier.

## The FastAI Approach

FastAI makes complex deep learning surprisingly accessible:

```python
from fastai.vision.all import *

# Create DataLoaders
dls = ImageDataLoaders.from_folder(
    path='data/images', 
    train='train', 
    valid='valid',
    item_tfms=Resize(224),
    batch_tfms=aug_transforms()
)

# Create learner with pre-trained model
learn = vision_learner(dls, resnet34, metrics=accuracy)
learn.fine_tune(4)
```

## Key Insights

**Transfer Learning** - Pre-trained models like ResNet dramatically improve results with limited data.

**Data Augmentation** - Simple transformations boost model generalization significantly.

**Learning Rate** - FastAI's learning rate finder is a game-changer for optimization.

## Real Application

I applied these concepts to my [Architectural Style Classifier](https://github.com/adilsiraju/Architecture-Style-Classifier/), achieving **73% accuracy** across 25 architectural styles through:

- Quality data curation
- Appropriate augmentation for architectural images  
- Smart fine-tuning strategy

## Next Steps

- Advanced augmentation techniques
- Model interpretation with GradCAM
- Production deployment strategies
- Multi-label classification
