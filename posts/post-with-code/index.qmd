## FastAI Journey: Building My First Image Classifier

As part of my FastAI course journey, I'm diving deep into computer vision fundamentals. Today, I want to share my experience building an image classifier and the key insights I've gained.

## The FastAI Approach

One of the things I love about FastAI is how it makes complex deep learning concepts accessible. Here's a simple example of building an image classifier:

```python
from fastai.vision.all import *

# Create a DataBlock for image classification
dls = ImageDataLoaders.from_folder(
    path='data/images', 
    train='train', 
    valid='valid',
    item_tfms=Resize(224),
    batch_tfms=aug_transforms()
)

# Create a learner with a pre-trained model
learn = vision_learner(dls, resnet34, metrics=accuracy)

# Fine-tune the model
learn.fine_tune(4)
```

## Key Learnings So Far

### 1. Transfer Learning is Powerful
Starting with pre-trained models like ResNet significantly reduces training time and improves accuracy, especially with limited data.

### 2. Data Augmentation Matters
Simple transformations can dramatically improve model generalization:

```python
# Example augmentations
aug_transforms(
    mult=0.5,  # Probability multiplier
    do_flip=True,  # Random horizontal flips
    flip_vert=False,  # No vertical flips for natural images
    max_rotate=10.0,  # Slight rotations
    max_zoom=1.1,  # Minor zoom variations
    max_lighting=0.2,  # Lighting changes
    max_warp=0.2  # Perspective warping
)
```

### 3. Learning Rate is Critical
Finding the optimal learning rate using FastAI's learning rate finder has been a game-changer:

```python
# Find optimal learning rate
learn.lr_find()

# Use the suggested learning rate
learn.fine_tune(4, lr=1e-3)
```

## Applying to My Architecture Classifier

These concepts directly applied to my [Architectural Style Classifier project](https://github.com/adilsiraju/Architecture-Style-Classifier/), where I achieved 73% accuracy across 25 architectural styles. The key was:

- **Quality data curation** from Kaggle datasets
- **Appropriate data augmentation** for architectural images
- **Fine-tuning strategy** that preserved pre-trained features while adapting to architectural styles

## Next Steps

I'm planning to explore:
- Advanced augmentation techniques
- Model interpretation with GradCAM
- Deployment strategies for production use
- Multi-label classification problems

## Resources I'm Using

- [FastAI Book](https://course.fast.ai/) - Comprehensive and practical
- [Papers with Code](https://paperswithcode.com/) - Latest research implementations
- [Kaggle Datasets](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets) - Quality training data
