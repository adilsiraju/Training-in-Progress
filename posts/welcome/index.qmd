## Hello and Welcome! ðŸ‘‹

I'm excited to start this blog as a way to document my learning journey in **Artificial Intelligence** and **Machine Learning**. As someone who has just completed my B.E. in AI & ML with First Class with Distinction, I'm now diving deeper into practical applications and advanced concepts.

## What This Blog Represents

This space serves multiple purposes:

- **ðŸ“š Learning Documentation**: Recording my progress through courses like FastAI
- **ðŸ’¡ Project Showcases**: Sharing the ML/DL projects I'm building
- **ðŸ”¬ Technical Insights**: Deep dives into algorithms, techniques, and best practices
- **ðŸš€ Career Growth**: Tracking my evolution as an AI/ML engineer

## My Current Focus

Right now, I'm particularly focused on:

- **FastAI Course**: Learning practical deep learning approaches
- **Computer Vision**: Building on my architectural style classifier project
- **MLOps**: Expanding my deployment and pipeline automation skills
- **Real-world Applications**: Bridging the gap between theory and practice

## What You Can Expect

In upcoming posts, you'll find:

- Detailed walkthroughs of my FastAI learning progress
- Project breakdowns with code examples and insights
- Challenges I face and how I overcome them
- Resources and tools that I find valuable
- Reflections on the AI/ML industry and trends

## Let's Connect!

I believe learning is better when shared. Feel free to reach out if you're on a similar journey, have questions about my projects, or want to collaborate on something interesting!
