## Hello! ðŸ‘‹

Welcome to my blog where I document my journey in **Artificial Intelligence** and **Machine Learning**. Having completed my B.E. in AI & ML with distinction, I'm now diving deeper into practical applications.

## Purpose

This blog serves as:

- **Learning Documentation** - Recording progress through courses like FastAI
- **Project Showcases** - Sharing ML/DL projects and implementations  
- **Technical Insights** - Deep dives into algorithms and best practices
- **Career Growth** - Tracking my evolution as an AI/ML engineer

## Current Focus

- **FastAI Course** - Practical deep learning approaches
- **Computer Vision** - Extending my architectural classifier project
- **MLOps** - Deployment and automation skills
- **Real-world Applications**: Bridging the gap between theory and practice

## What You Can Expect

In upcoming posts, you'll find:

- Detailed walkthroughs of my FastAI learning progress
- Project breakdowns with code examples and insights
- Challenges I face and how I overcome them
- Resources and tools that I find valuable
- Reflections on the AI/ML industry and trends

## Let's Connect!

I believe learning is better when shared. Feel free to reach out if you're on a similar journey, have questions about my projects, or want to collaborate on something interesting!
